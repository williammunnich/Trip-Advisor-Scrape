We like to introduce out of town friends and family to the joy of Segwaying - but even locals who have never Segwayed before love the experience and tours and learn something new about local history.  The guides have all been entertaining and knowledgeable, and this latest trip, despite rain, was a lot of fun!  This wonâ€™t be our last time!  Highly recommend enjoying one of these adventures!",

The tour was excellent.  Tim was kind and knowledgeable, was flexible and tailored my tour to my interests.  I cannot say enough about how great it was.  It was a beautiful day to be out and I got to see all of the points of interest I wanted to see.  The management team were so accommodating and worked with my schedule so that I could have this opportunity to experience the Segway tour.  It was a wonderful experience and I will likely do Segway tours on future travels.  Iâ€™m hooked now.
