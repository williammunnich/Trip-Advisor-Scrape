It was absolutely amazing!  We had a blast just riding the segways around town, but also learned so much about the history of the area. All of the guides were incredibly helpful and informative which made the trip that much more enjoyable.

Michael,Tate and Phil gave us a great tour of the Minneapolis river front. We learned and saw things that we had never experienced.  As a lifelong resident of the area we didn’t know what we were missing. The tour was almost perfect except it started raining half way through. But they had us covered, ponchos for everyone! It was even fun in the rain. We will definitely take Segways tours on future trips. Maybe even another one in our backyard."

review_73829716,"mirandahermanSeattle, Washington1214A BLAST - Would do AgainReview ofMagical History TourReviewed August 4, 2010I've recently done both the Magical history segway tour in Minneapolis as well as the one in Saint Paul and both were great! Both times I went with my husband and siblings and we had a blast. It is such a fun way to learn the history and see the sights, and cruising on a segway is pretty awesome. Between the two tours, the Saint Paul Segway tour was by far our favorite. The Minneapolis tour was fun, but we didn't like how large the tour sizes were. The day we toured, our group had almost 40 people. With that large of group, it was difficult to hear the guides and get the most out of the tour. The Saint Paul tour is much smaller and frankly not very well known, so the day we took the tour it was just us 4! We had the tour all to ourselves and it was great. The tour guide was awesome - very informative, funny and got along with us great. Along the ride we stopped for pictures at various locations and even had enough time to spare that we got to spend some time touring the Saint Paul Cathedral. I found the tour in Saint Paul to be a lot more interesting and fun overall. However, I'd highly suggest both of them.>>Ask mirandaherman about Magical History Tour2Thank mirandahermanThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

First off, the riding the Segways are way cool!  Following our guide single file did not give much of an opportunity to really ""see what they could do"" but there were a few stops taken where if you wanted, you could cruise around and get the RPM's up.  Riding is very easy-after some good instruction from the guides and 10 minutes of practice it felt automatic.  It gets to the point where it's almost like walking in that you can make it do what you want without really even thinking about it.  The tour itself was pretty interesting-better than I thought it would be reading some of the earlier reviews.  Yes, there was a silly instructional video to watch and yes, we had a good 20 minutes of riding around in circles before we took off but still a very enjoyable experience.  One could ask if it was really worth $80 a piece . . .but it was vacation and it just meant less purchases when we got back to the mall.

review_74529759,"MN_5130Philadelphia, PA2939Nice tour, way too much training/prepReview ofMagical History TourReviewed August 9, 2010With a limited amount of time in MN, my friend (a local) and I decided the Magical History tour would be a great, fun way to see the area.  The guides/employees at MHT are great, but it is far from being a well-oiled machine.  We arrived for our 10am tour at 9:30am, as instructed, and did not get started on the actual tour until 11am.  90 minutes of ""training"" watching a training video and more ""training"" was an insane waste of time.  Regardless of insurance issues, these are segways, not space shuttles.  It takes about ten minutes to get used to the segway, and 80 minutes of wasted time.  That being said, the actual tour was two hours, as promised.  However, MHTs is not a ""quick"" way to see the sights - it was 4 hours when it was all said and done.  The tour itself was nice (free snacks at the Mill City museum was a great marketing tool), but we were in two groups of 20 so we didn't get to do everything I wanted to do (""Like, hey, what's that?  Can we stop over there?).  If MHT was less interested in booking a large number of people, they could offer a more personal experience that $86 should buy you.Ask MN_5130 about Magical History Tour3Thank MN_5130This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Well worth the money!Review ofMagical History TourReviewed September 12, 2016via mobileI had such a great time on the Segway Magical History Tour.  Thomas was an awesome tour guide.  Funny, informative, and pleasant.  He knew the answer to every question I had.  I had never been on a Segway before, but the guides made sure we were all comfortable and we had a short orientation on the Segway before the tour.  In just a few minutes, everyone was comfortable on the Segway, and off we went.  At $90 and 3 hours, I felt this tour was worth every penny.  I felt like we covered a lot of downtown Minneapolis and got an in depth look and breakdown of everything we saw.  Lots of history along the river.  Also, I liked how we stopped often to walk around and explore every few minutes.  I've seen a lot of Segway tours that don't really stop, and just keep going.   It was a nice mix of Segway, walking, and exploring.  Excellent, informative tour.  Would love to do the St. Paul tour next time.Date of experience:September 2016>>>>Ask cmccormick101 about Magical History Tour1Thank cmccormick101This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

A bit pricey if you have to take the  whole family ($80+tax/person + $7 parking + tip), but consider it part culture, part history, part amusement park ride, and part being a kid again.

He tried to console me by saying he'd broken his elbow on a Segway and that I'd be back up on the machines in no time.We were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary with this tour, to be followed by reservations at a fine local restaurant. We walked by the Magical History Tour every year as we attended MSPIFF at St. Anthony Main, and we always wanted to go on this tour. The people looked like they were having a lot of fun. I should have done some more research than just checking Trip Advisor. Accidents are common on Segway machines.We were at the end of the training the tour does under the bridge and as we dispersed, someone else's Segway's wheel touch mine and made my Segway's gyroscope go nuts. I spun and fell backwards, hitting the ground very hard.Yes, I needed an ambulance. My ankle was dislocated and my leg was broken in four places. I needed surgery surgery. And still six weeks post accident I'm still not weight-bearing on my right leg.So before going on this tour, check out not just Trip Advisor but find out about the safety of the Segway machines. Make sure you're wearing a helmet. Bring your own in fact. I found out after this tour that bike helmets should be replaced after accidents because the structural integrity of helmets is compromised after impact.The tour did refund our tour fee. The owner called the next day but kept insisting that ""this never happens,"" and offered to comp us on our next tour with them.

review_518852793,"nmhenNew York336181Great way to see the sights!Review ofMagical History TourReviewed August 29, 2017We did the magical history tour, with Rachel and Tate as our guides.  We were a party of 5, with three adults (one of whom had never been on a segway before), and two kids (13 and 12).  Very comfortable, no-pressure set-up.  You do a little test run before you have to pay (in case you don't like it), and then there's an instructional/safety video, and then an on-board instructional/familiarity session.  In other words, they make every effort to give you the opportunity to get comfortable on the segway before you go.The tour was outstanding.  I grew up in the Twin Cities, and we saw places I had never been to before.  You get lots of time riding (driving?) the segway.  No, it's not cheap (around $100/person), but all the time on the segway makes it worth it.  Tons of information, funny anecdotes, and the usual joking around that you'd expect on an historical tour like this.  The stop in the Mill City museum was fine - the snack was a cookie and a beverage.We had a great time.

My friend was a little nervous about riding the segway, but they give you good training and you watch a video too. She felt very comfortable by the time we were done and can't wait to do it again. The stops were interesting and informative. This tour was the highlight of our visit."

review_234882748,"Jerry S4A delightful afternoon in Minneapolis, NMReview ofMagical History TourReviewed October 17, 2014My wife found this tour online and booked our visit.  We arrived early and stopped at one of the several nearby food places to eat a delightful lunch prior to our tour.  I was skeptical that I would be comfortable riding the Segway at 71 years of age, but the expert and gentle training followed by a few minutes of free riding I felt like a pro and after 30 minutes into the tour I was able to release one handlebar and take pictures as I rode.  (Note: they recommend that you NOT do this, but did not take any notice when I did it anyway.)  Our guide was friendly and knowledgeable.  The tour stays off the main streets so there was little problems with traffic and the path took us to a museum for snacks and water, the waterfront, dams and locks, then on to a private island with quaint houses and beautiful gardens.  Needless to say I had plenty of pictures at the end of the trip and the experience of riding a Segway was an absolute pleasure.  I felt like  a kid again. If you are in the area I highly recommend this trip even if you are not a history buff.  There is much to enjoy the afternoon sun and wind with a group of like minded people with new toys to ride.  Please note that this attraction requires you stand the entire trip except for the few stops along the way.  Only one person is allowed per Segway and during the ride you need both hands on the controls so holding a baby is not possible.  Backpacks are needed if you wish to carry anything with you.  The guides have a pack on their Segway, but the customer units do not.Date of experience:August 2014Review collected in partnership with this attractionThis business uses tools provided by Tripadvisor (or one of its official Review Collection Partners) to encourage and collect guest reviews, including this one.Ask Jerry S about Magical History TourThank Jerry SThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There were only 3 people on this tour(weekday off season), and we got lots of specialized attention.  First they take you outside and teach you how to ride the segway(loads of fun), make sure you can get on and off(the most difficult part), and then take you up one side and accross a bridge to the other side of the river.  The tour lasts about 2 hours and include a break with free cookie and drink at the mill museum.  My husband is not adventurous, and I was a little surprised he was willing to try a segway, but once he got the hang of it he really liked it.

It was a beautiful fall day and our guides,  Michael and Bill were fantastic. Michael was so engaging,  knowledgeable,  and humorous too. Bill was attentive,  helpful,  and offered to take pics of us often.  They even gifted the birthday boy with a free t- shirt.  We did the magical history tour of Minneapolis and I learned so much even though I'm a local.  We all agreed we want to try the sculpture garden tour from Human on a Stick next.

review_116171429,"Reviewer____1980_11Toronto11Painfully slow start and disorganized, but worth itReview ofMagical History TourReviewed August 2, 2011Overall this was a great tour, I got to see parts of the city that I would otherwise not see.  The guide was informative and funny and kept a pretty good pace too.  However the segway ""training"" and signup is almost unbearable.  It was completely unorganized and painfully slow.  I rushed to ensure that I got to the location on time only to wait through more than an hours worth of training.  The training video alone was 15+ minutes long, repetitive and did not really apply (ex. why do I need to know how to charge it?  Or learn about the dangers of lending it to others).  It was geared more to someone buying a Segway rather than a tourist using it for 3 hours.  Actual Segway training was slow to the point of it being impressive (I was impressed that they could be so slow and unorganized), they trained us one at a time, a couple of minutes each.  At one point there were more than 60 tourists and only two trainers!!  Then after waiting 15+ minutes to pay, they turned on each of the machines and helped each person on their machine, ONE by ONE.  Then after more waiting, they gave a lesson on how to get off the machine!!   Then, there is another 10-15 minutes of waiting because there were multiple tours and they had to space them out.  Once the tour began, as said above, was great but registration and training is so poorly done.  The tour could have been 30-40 minutes longer if less time was wasted.Date of experience:July 2011Ask Reviewer____1980_11 about Magical History Tour1Thank Reviewer____1980_11This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We got some quick instruction, safety training and practice on the Segways. It was really easy to pick up how to ride them. We started at St. Anthony Main, went across the Stone Arch Bridge, stopped at The Guthrie for about 20 minutes, continued North along the West side of the river. Then we crossed at some bridge and came back to St. Anthony Main. Made several stops along the way where the guides explained some history. The history seemed to be given through a hippie/grunge filter, or whatever the kids are into these days. The guides were all friendly and helpful.The highlight was the eye-popping, visually stunning, squirming, stretching, squatting, back arching lesson on the history of Boom Island.

review_285920995,"TheKnittingDykeMinneapolis, Minnesota1119My SouvenirReview ofMagical History TourReviewed July 5, 2015I thought ""something's very wrong with my ankle"" as I lie on the ground and the tour guide asked if I could drive or if I needed an ambulance. He tried to console me by saying he'd broken his elbow on a Segway and that I'd be back up on the machines in no time.We were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary with this tour, to be followed by reservations at a fine local restaurant. We walked by the Magical History Tour every year as we attended MSPIFF at St. Anthony Main, and we always wanted to go on this tour. The people looked like they were having a lot of fun. I should have done some more research than just checking Trip Advisor. Accidents are common on Segway machines.We were at the end of the training the tour does under the bridge and as we dispersed, someone else's Segway's wheel touch mine and made my Segway's gyroscope go nuts. I spun and fell backwards, hitting the ground very hard.Yes, I needed an ambulance. My ankle was dislocated and my leg was broken in four places. I needed surgery surgery. And still six weeks post accident I'm still not weight-bearing on my right leg.So before going on this tour, check out not just Trip Advisor but find out about the safety of the Segway machines. Make sure you're wearing a helmet. Bring your own in fact. I found out after this tour that bike helmets should be replaced after accidents because the structural integrity of helmets is compromised after impact.The tour did refund our tour fee. The owner called the next day but kept insisting that ""this never happens,"" and offered to comp us on our next tour with them. Which will never happen.And I wish everyone who goes on this tour luck.

It was good to stop at intervals and take in the views along the Mississippi. All staff were friendly and helpful. The issue of Segway licences are a great gag and we made good use of the 25% voucher off nearby restaurants they provided.

Both were fabulous in different ways.  The History Tour has frequent stops with entertaining stories along the way.  The Sculpture Garden covers a lot more distance - so you really get to go on the Segway.  The tour guides are unfailingly nice, polite and helpful.  Don't let the thought of riding a Segway scare you - my parents are 70 and 67 and did fine - Mom was hesitant at first, but took to them like a duck to water!

review_382981088,"sweetpea055Gatineau,Quebec136Fantastic way to tour MinneapolisReview ofMagical History TourReviewed June 15, 2016This is a three hour sightseeing tour of many historical and picturesque parts of Minneapolis, while you are riding your own Segway. Absolutely awesome. This was our first time on a Segway and after a 15 minute training session I was amazed that I could then ride around downtown, cross bridges, go through parks and off-road on a Segway without any problems. Our tour guide was a guy named Chris and he was so knowledgeable of all the landmarks, the history and he told a lot of extra stories about his city because of his background education. Usually the tour takes out about 15 or 20 people at once but on this day we were the first tour of the morning and it was just the three of us that were booked. It was extra special and it felt like our own personal tour. Chris was very polite and had a great sense of humor. He took many photos of us and the landmarks. We had a stop over at the Mill Museum for about 30 minutes to enjoy a free coffee and cookie from a coffee shop inside, which is part of the tour package. I cannot say enough about this attraction. If you are visiting Minneapolis or even if you live there, you should take this tour. Myself, my husband and our 21 year old son had the most amazing time. We learnt so much and had a blast on a Segway.

review_118031801,"Kimberly COconomowoc, Wisconsin918Minneapolis segway toursReview ofMagical History TourReviewed September 12, 2011If you have never done this before, your in for a real treat!  I have been on 2 of the Segway tours in Minneapolis.  the sculpture garden tours and the magical history tour.  thought I would give you my impressions and hope it helps in making a decision as to which one to take.First, For all of the people that are nervous to go on a segway, let me say this,  It is easy to learn and they teach you how to get on and off the machine with out any issues.   The tour guides will have you believing you are the master of the segway with in 20 mins. I had been on the Dallas, Tx  Segway tour and thought that this would be a neat thing to take my kids on.  They are 18 and 13.  They both thought it was very cool and fun to zoom around on them.The first tour we did was the sculpture garden tour.  I had never seen the sculpture garden and was looking forward to it.  The tour is about 2 and 1/2 hours long not including the training session.  Although I loved the sculpture garden, I don't think I would do this tour again.  It is a very LONG way there.  After the initial crossing the Mississippi River on the bridge and seeing a couple things in the city where the tour guides promote the other tours it is a lot of straight runs that have nothing to see until you actually get to the garden.  Of course you do get to go under Target Stadium where the Twin's play, but it wasn't very exciting.   By the time you get to the Garden your legs will welcome the walk to see some of the beautiful art.  Be sure to go through the arbor of flowers and the botanical gardens as well.  After about 30 min break and a little water.  We loaded back up to head back to home start.  We maneuvered up the walking ramps that spiraled around and went over a major highway.  That was fun only because it wasn't a straight line.  We went through a couple of lovely parks and stopped a couple times for photo ops and some history.  But The sculpture gardens is the main focus.  Also navigating the down town stop lights was not fun as our group of 10 could never make it though 2 lights all together and always were waiting.   I think we had to get through 6 or 7 lights.  When we came back the second time, We drove to see the sculpture gardens and took a different segway tour.The other tour is called the Magical Mystery Tour.  It is by far the most popular and you will have usually 20-25 people in the group plus 4 to 5 tour guides.   The guides take turns along the way in talking about the Minneapolis history.  This tour is about 3 hours long include a 20 min training session.  There was probably about 10 stops on this tour to describe the history.  One stop a the Mill Museum is particularly interesting.  It is about 1/2 point on the tour and they give you about 30 minutes to walk through the old mill that was the site of a flour explosion and now is a museum.  Very interesting.  My kids liked this tour a lot more, because they got to see more and learn more.The company name is ""Human on a Stick"" Segway tours.  They aren't cheap but they are professional.  Carmen was great, but I am not sure she is there once school starts as she said she was a teacher.  After the tour, They give you  a coupon for a 25% discount on  lunch/ dinner for the restaurants that are adjacent to the tour start.   We ate  dinner at Vics on the porch.  Very good! Had the new york strip and one of us have walleye.  No complaints.  Wine selection was limited but very good. The next time we tried Tugs.  More on the casual side. But good just the same.   Great burgers and salads.Take the family for a experience they won't soon forget.   Take Grandma and grandpa too!

I have been on 2 of the Segway tours in Minneapolis.  the sculpture garden tours and the magical history tour.  thought I would give you my impressions and hope it helps in making a decision as to which one to take.First, For all of the people that are nervous to go on a segway, let me say this,  It is easy to learn and they teach you how to get on and off the machine with out any issues.   The tour guides will have you believing you are the master of the segway with in 20 mins. I had been on the Dallas, Tx  Segway tour and thought that this would be a neat thing to take my kids on.  They are 18 and 13.  They both thought it was very cool and fun to zoom around on them.The first tour we did was the sculpture garden tour.  I had never seen the sculpture garden and was looking forward to it.  The tour is about 2 and 1/2 hours long not including the training session.

Kelly and Chris did a GREAT as tour guides. We were a small group and got to spend a lot of time with them and, like the best guides, they both made us feel like we were old friends and that they genuinely enjoyed spending time with us. Chris, who was in charge of the back of the tour, did an especially good job talking to whoever happened to be last in line. He took the time to ask where we were from, what brought us to town and shared a lot of interesting info about the architecture of the area.This was a great introduction to Minneaoplis!

Our family of three were the only ones taking the tour on an unusually warm (80 degrees!) and sunny early spring day and that made the experience all the more ""magical"". Jim was very knowledgeable and thorough and answered all our questions related to the city's history. Although the Mill City Museum was closed due to the raging (still!) pandemic, we did not feel like the tour lacked anything. Obviously with the small size of the group and no tour of the Mill City Museum, the trip did not last the full 3 hours but we were ready to be done from the extensive rounds on both sides of the river under the unusually hot sun.

If you find that not interesting, you can just enjoy the ride and the views.We've done this in other cities, so I feel comfortable saying that this company runs a very well-organized tour with a focus on safety.

review_403856343,"358vikihFlorida8440Totally AwesomeReview ofMagical History TourReviewed August 10, 2016Our first time on a Segway, what fun. Our granddaughter, who can't ride a bicycle due to balance, rode just fine on the Segway.  Good safety video prior to beginning the tour.  Watch it and remember it folks!  We had 3 spills due to people trying to do things the video and our tour guides defined as dangerous and improper use of Segway.  Things like trying to go up/down a curb will cause you to fall.  Our tour guide, Chris, and the rest of the crew were patient teaching us to ride and giving us time to practice prior to tour beginning.  Chris gave excellent information about the city and surroundings at all of our stops.   This was a LONG tour and we were extremely tired by the end.  Most stops had nowhere to sit and rest so everyone ended up standing for the 10 - 15 minutes or more likely playing on their Segway.Several suggestions for the folks at Segway as I know that they read their reviews.  Get some type small portable speaker system.  It was difficult to hear Chris and the information at times due to traffic and other noise. Reduce the stop times everywhere except the mill where we had a snack and only 15 minutes. Include in your briefing that the Segway crew carries water for anyone who needs it.  Give clear instructions on your website about parking availability and recommendations.  I would have liked to see something about bringing a backpack and with water, snacks, etc.  We were on the 2:30 tour and finished up about 6PM.  Although we stopped several times, there was only 1 stop for refreshments, sit-down  rest, and toilet break.  We ended up stopping again, about 3 blocks from the office because one of the riders fell and hurt herself this was the first time I heard about the guides bringing water for the riders.Overall we loved the tour and would do it again!

review_304803822,"GA_WrenAtlanta, Georgia2248Fun City OrientationReview ofMagical History TourReviewed August 29, 2015This tour offers an informative overview of what makes Minneapolis - Minneapolis. Of how it fits in America's story, how it rose in significance, what businesses and people were a part of its history. It's like taking a scooter through a history book.Disadvantages:  Finding parking/directions was confusing.  I ended up 5 minutes away because I was on the east section instead of the west section of the street (or vice versa).  We were on the wrong side of the river.  Then I attempted to call them for clarification, and was forwarded to voicemail.  Grrrr. When we finally got to the right place, I had to use my spider sense to find the place.  The entrance was down a flight of stairs to the riverbank. When we entered, there was a group already watching a funny segway safety video ahead of us.  The cartoon showed all the ways that stick figures could fall off a segway - in slow motion.  We just sat and watched and not sure if we were with the right group or not.  We weren't, but we found our people at our designated time.Nice parts:  We spent a fair amount of time getting acquainted with our segways.  We rode in circles underneath an area under a bridge.  Segways are very sensitive to body weight, and I had a blast zipping around and watching the swallows dive effortlessly under the bridge with us.The tour was awesome.  We would stop periodically, park our segways, and listen to the guide talk about the Pislbury - Gold Medal rivalry, bridges, beer barons, and more.  I crossed the Mississippi three times and cool breeze and views were awesome.  Plenty of opportunity to snap photos and ask questions.  And we did stop inside a museum for a brief break with water and free cookies! I definitely understand why people love this tour.A few notes: you will be standing on your segway for 2+ hours, and don't use your phone while you segway.  I plead the fifth on that one.  Ladies, make sure you have enough support, too; because it gets a little bumpy in some parts.  And the tour is not cheap - $80+ per person.After the tour, we received dinner coupons for walking distance restaurants, and a segway driver's license.

review_385011353,"biancaa0513Baltimore, Maryland126Perfect for a short visit to MinneapolisReview ofMagical History TourReviewed June 22, 2016My friend and I were only in Minneapolis for a day and a half, but wanted to see as much as we could. We decided on the Segway tour 1) because SEGWAYS! and 2) because of the history aspect to it. We learned so much during our couple hour tour and it really gave us a new perspective on the city. Plus, we used our free admission to the Mill Museum and discount on dinner, which were both awesome additions to tour. My friend and I ended up being the only ones signed up for the tour that day, so it was sort of like a private tour of everything, which was awesome!

We decided on the Segway tour 1) because SEGWAYS! and 2) because of the history aspect to it. We learned so much during our couple hour tour and it really gave us a new perspective on the city. Plus, we used our free admission to the Mill Museum and discount on dinner, which were both awesome additions to tour. My friend and I ended up being the only ones signed up for the tour that day, so it was sort of like a private tour of everything, which was awesome!

It's a bit pricey but for the length of time you go out, it's not bad.  Our tour was about 2.5 hours, including the training.  Learning the Segways was a breeze, and even though some people had troubles getting the hang of it, the staff was patient and accommodating and was able to get them squared away.  They were very informative about the different aspects of Minneapolis's history of flour mills.  The weather was awesome the day we went, which made it all the better.  Now we are heading to Maui and are considering doing a Segway tour there as well.  After the tour, they gave us a coupon for a free tour of the Mill Museum (which is one of the places we stopped off briefly). We went back there the next day and check it out, an $11 value!

Guides were right there when you needed help, but otherwise stayed back and let you ""play"" once you get the hang of how to operate the machine. Route is just the right length and level to give you a great first experience on a Segway."

We've been visiting Minneapolis for several years, and have toured many of its museums, but this was the most enjoyable way we've learned about several historical sites around downtown and Nicolette Island. The head tour guide was interesting and informative. The other tour guides taught us to ride our Segways safely and took great pictures of us throughout the tour. We will definitely do another Segway tour in another city. It was a great way to get around and learn about the city."

This is the first work event I have attended where every single person remarked how much fun they had.  They guides were very patient as we learned how to handle the segways.  They took some getting used to but still fun (the segways not the guides).  Wear flat and comfortable shoes - you are standing for a few hours, but also get plenty of breaks.  The tour was nice.

The Segway Magical History Tour was suggested by a colleague and it was the best three hours I have spent exploring a new city.After a training video, instructions from the staff, and a little practice, the Segway was easy to grasp. The Segway was a safe, fun, and a quick way to see all of the sights along the massive Mississippi River. The tour zips by old flower mills, along converted railroad paths, and miles of urban green space.The staff take great pride in their work and provide a great amount of detail when telling the history of Minneapolis. One guide, Chris, is even writing a creative non-fiction book about many of the sights on the tour.With the rental price, you get free refreshments at the Mill City Museum, 25% off of one of three restaurants, free admission to the Mill City Museum, and 20% off your next tour. If you have three hours to take a fun tour, be sure to check out the Magical History Tour; the price is well worth the tour and all of the perks.

My cousin invited us so we went and had a WONDERFUL time.  We went on the Magical History Tour which takes you on both sides of the Mississippi in downtown Minneapolis.  Initially, one of the guides showed each of us how to get on and off the segway and led us a few feet, next we went inside and got a helmet, then we watched a video.  It was good that we saw the videa AFTER we first tried out the segway or it might of scared us off.  I know they have to make you aware of all the dangers.  Next you get your segway and walk across the street, under and overpass, and receive more instruction and some practice.  After that you are off on an adventure.It was REALLY easy and fun.  We had a gorgeous day.  There were 15  or so in our group plus 5 guides.  We toured along and would stop and hear the history of Minneapolis.  We got to see 8 different wedding parties including one that bicycled across the bridge to Nicollet Island, probably a 75 people on bikes.About half way through we stopped at the Mill Museum for a bathroom break, a drink and a large cookie.  I wish we had had time to spend in the musuem.At the end of the tour they give you your own segway driver's license, 25% off coupons for four of the restaurants in the area and a free pass to the Mill Museum.  The individual cost of the tour per person was $80.  Afterwards we ate at one of the restaurants.It was a wonderful way to spend a sunny, pleasant afternoon and a chicken highly recommends it.

Riding the Segway was a little intimidating and there were some falls and crashes, but no one was hurt and the falls became part of the adventure.  Several guides accompanied us and were quick to lend a hand to anyone who needed a little help.

You can also get a free T-Shirt and the guides take pictures of the tour group ""in action"" which you can download for free.

We made several stops, getting off them to listen to the guides present information all along the Mississippi where this city got its start and flour milling was the big industry. We stopped at the first permanent bridge in the US, over this river, and later, in view of the new 35W bridge that replaced the one that collapsed in the 2007 disaster. I read several negatives here, after taking the tour but, going midweek, we had a every manageable size group, a complaint of some here.

I was nervous having never been on a Segway before but got to have a go before paying to ensure I could do it. The instructions were good and the guides stayed spread out in the group to look after everyone. The history was interesting and there were plenty of photo stops. A couple of minor things stopped this being 5 stars- they took bottles of water to give out for refreshments but only some people got them as they didn't bring enough for everyone. They also didn't introduce the team at the start and two helpers didn't have name badges on so it was a little awkward. But all in all a great fun activity which I would happily recommend and do again.Date of experience:July 2017Ask JillH1280 about Magical History TourThank JillH1280This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

review_862312636,"KathleensHome1You're not too old!Review ofMagical History TourReviewed September 28, 2022What a fun experience!  I took the Minneapolis tour with guides Thomas, Denny, and Tim.  They were wonderful!  The morning was invigorating and educational.  Whether you are a visitor to the Twin Cities, or a lifelong resident like myself, it was great to learn the history behind the landmarks I've seen for years.  I have to admit, at age 70, I was a little concerned as to my ability to ride a Segway, especially for 2.5 to 3 hours.  However, the guides teach you well, keep a watchful eye at all times, and stay close by to offer assistance if needed.  I actually found it to be a piece of cake and quickly felt very comfortable. There were other participants several years my senior. Additionally, because we made several stops along the way, the time went by quickly and easily.  If you are wanting to find a fun little adventure, I highly recommend this tour.Date of experience:September 2022Ask KathleensHome about Magical History TourThank KathleensHomeThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

review_115941726,"Steve SDes Moines, Iowa5627One of the best attractions in Minneapolis!Review ofMagical History TourReviewed July 28, 2011This was our first Segway tour, and we LOVED it!  We had two kids with us (18 and 19), and we all thoroughly enjoyed this tour.  There were about 16 people on our particular tour with 4 tour guides.  The Segway is an excellent way to see a number of riverfront sights up close while giving you the mobility to cover quite a bit of area.  We had a gorgeous day and were able to take some great photos, even though we only had our cell phone camera.We had no problems using the Segways.  The tour guides did a great job helping the group get confident with the machines, and as we moved along, you could see everyone's confidence continue to grow.Just a few learnings from our tour - even though the company doesn't require it, be sure to wear shoes (tennis shoes are fine) for the tour, rather than sandals/flip flops, to protect your feet/toes from scrapes when stepping off/on your Segway.  If the day is sunny, put on sunscreen as you'll be in the sun a lot.  Also, take a small camera - you'll have some excellent photo opportunities.  Finally, I don't think younger kids (below 14) would enjoy the history nearly as much as older kids/adults, and it may be too tempting for them to hot dog with the Segway which may create problems for themselves or others on the tour.Although the cost is expensive ($80/person), we thought the tour was worth the money and a great way to enjoy Minneapolis!Date of experience:July 2011>>>Ask Steve S about Magical History Tour1Thank Steve SThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I learned that WCCO ( a long time established local radio station ) was named by the Washburn-Crosby COmpany, forerunner of General Mills.I thought Chris did a wonderful job of balancing information for out-of-town tourists and us locals.  Site visit to Mill City Museum was enjoyable and river scenery interesting & relaxing.Chris and a tour guide assistant were very accommodating & gracious when I asked to drop out of the tour 45 minutes early.  I had been sick the week prior. The wind picked up & temperature dropped so wanted to get out of the colder weather.Segways are easy and fun to use.  A woman in our group was nervous to try a Segway and thought she'd never be able to master it (she almost cancelled coming with us).

We stopped several times to listen to the history of the area, and it was very interesting ~ many things I did not know about Minneapolis even living here so long.

The guides on this tour were not just informed, but truly nice people. The three hours went surprisingly fast and my son and I agree this was a highlight of our road trip together.
