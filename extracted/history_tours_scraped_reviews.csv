Unlike many tours this was not just memorized talking points, Andy was a history major and is passionate about it. Questions are welcomed and encouraged leading to lots of fun facts tangents.I can hardly wait to do the Minnesota tour next. I highly recommend this tour to both local residents and out of town guests."

I was excited to try it -- never having been on one previously -- and, a little cautious. . .  My friends have done it many times, and assure me it was easy.We took the ""Historic Tour of Minneapolis"" on a Wednesday afternoon. It was so fun. At first I was cautious about getting on a Segway. But the ""practice"" time, before the tour began, along with the genuinely attentive instructors, made me feel right at ease. They stayed with any and every student who had the least bit of concern about riding/guiding/stopping/starting a Segway. Before I knew it, I was a Segway Master!I am 70 and have good balance. However, learning to ""move"" by ""leaning"" was a new experience. I am not a speeder by any standards, and I thoroughly enjoyed the pace of our tour. There were several instructors with our group of 21, and the instructors were always sprinkled throughout our group as we traveled. No tour ""speaking"" began, until we were all off our Segways and assembled. I appreciated that kind of treatment. At the same time, it was sometimes difficult to hear the guide speaking since he often paced in front of the group, turning away from me -- I am hard of hearing, and the general noise of the traffic and the river, plus the wind, made it difficult to hear.One suggestion I offered was to give each guest a wireless ""Whisper."" I have used them in Europe on tours and could hear everything amid traffic and other sounds of the cities.  The Guide wears one with a microphone, and each guest turns their unit on, when the guide gives a talk. The unit is about the size of a pack of cigarettes and easily fits in a pocket or snaps on a belt or waistband.I LOVED this tour and will be eager to take other, similar tours when I can.Date of experience:August 2016Ask The_Goodins about St. Paul History TourThank The_GoodinsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

My wife decided to throw in some fun and some culture for breakfast. So off we went to be a part of the Magical History Tour, by Segway no less. I was very excited, because getting to learn to drive a Segway has been on my bucket list of things to do, ever since I'd seen the first Segways on TV and in the movies (Mall Cop). So with bated breath, I stood on my first Segway that morning. Jim, our leader, was able to convey the very nature of how to control and guide a Segway to his new pupils, within a matter of seconds. Before long I was moving forwards and back, turning and circling. Amazing.This tour starts under the Central Ave. Bridge on SE Main St., just across from their offices. Its where we learned how to pilot these very neat little vehicles. From there we drove, convoy style East on the bike paths (trails which rate only 2nd in my experience to breadth and usability I've experienced in the Netherlands) to the Stone Arch Bridge. Jim would stop and give us a history lesson every now and then to break up the ride. Then onto the Mill City Museum across the river where we enjoyed a snack, a quick tour of the museum and then all along the river bike trails to Plymouth Ave and onto Boom Island, Nicolett Island and back to their offices where we started.Hills, both uphill and downhill, some chances to get some speed (woohoo) and just the fun of touring on something other than our feet or a bike made this a wonderful late morning early afternoon outing.The only portion that seemed out of place was the snack/lunch portion at the Mills museum which left us wondering what we should be doing. The recommended spot was a cookie stop, which left us rather wanting. A picnic en route might be a bit more appropriate, keeping the people together and perhaps even interacting.Other than that, highly recommended.Date of experience:June 2016Ask Lucas K about St. Paul History Tour1Thank Lucas KThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

She describes herself as klutzy, uncoordinated, and with no confidence in her physical abilities her entire life and she is 67 now, so she wasn't going to change her opinion of herself now.   This was a wonderful way to spend an afternoon and we loved every minute of it.    I wasn't too interested in Minneapolis history prior to going, but it turned out to be fantastic, with Greg the tour leader making it extremely interesting.   My friend lacked confidence from the first minute, so after lagging waaaaay behind for the first two minutes and obviously going to put everyone in a position of being slowed to a crawl, Greg towed her the entire way at the front of the group where she was really flying and she just loved it and after that,  was happier than a clam and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.

First, I CAN RIDE A SEGWAY and it is sooooooooo much fun! We chose the Minneapolis Historic Riverfront tour which I would absolutely reccommend.Second, the staff was remarkable. Chris, was the lead and he provided historical information, at times in a humorous fashion. He did his job very well. Jessie brought up the rear of the tour and was absolutely OUTSTANDING!. She was with us every step of the way to ensure our safety. I believe if we were thinking about a concern, she had already read our mind and taken care of it.

We took the tour around the historic building and Mississippi River. Gary was our guide and is fantastic -- full of history, stories and very entertaining. We made sure to stay at the front of the line behind him so we could hear him as he rides facing backwards and narrates the whole time (don't know how he does this.....must have eyes in the back of his head, seriously). The guides are very careful to show you everything you need to know to get off and on the Segway and ride it. It will take you about 30 seconds to figure it out, max. We took a break in the Mill Museum where we had free coffee or soda and a cookie while enjoying the really neat environment of the old flour mill.

What a great way to see the sites and what fun for all of us learning to ride our machines.  My grandson jumped at the chance and wasn't disappointed. I especially loved touring the old homes on Nicollet Island and visiting the Guthrie Theatre. Gregg was a knowledgable guide with a good sense of humor.  My only disappointment, time went too fast.

However, when it came to the other riders who were not of color she was polite and treated them as equal.

We take a great deal of pride in our customer service experience. From the time you call to make a reservation, until the minute you walk out of our door at the end of a tour, we expect you to have a stellar experience. We are extremely disappointed to hear that Catherine this did not make this happen for you. She is someone who demands a lot from our staff. It is  unfortunate that she let that spill over onto our customer's perspectives. Catherine was very upset when she saw this review and was actually the one who brought this review to our attention. We assure you that this is something that has been addressed and will not happen again in the future.We would also like for you to give our company another chance.

review_600441487,"sbcaldNorthern Virginia, Virginia1well worth the time and admission fee - WELL DONEReview ofSt. Paul History TourReviewed July 28, 2018Very Well done. We were met by several ""Human on a Stick"" shirted employees that gave familiarization and hands on demonstration to the Segway.We went inside and saw pick out our riding helmets, watched a safety film, signed wavers and went back outside, picked up our Segway and pushed them to a practice area to get familiar with our steads in a nice practice area. Ray, Mary, Beth Ann, Julia were very competent and seemed to enjoy their work with the group. Ray was the lead, a cross between Tom Hanks and Hugh Grant was very personable and well voiced in the area and its history. Each segment was a nice jaunt through quite scenic areas on bike paths and such to several stops including a drink & cookie stop at the Mill City Museum.Very well done. We went in the morning (9:30 Magical History Tour $90) and it was a nice start to the day ending just after noon. Thank you MLPS Staff.Any worry about riding the Segway was quickly put to rest. Our group was from tweens to teens to us 20s-60s and some 70s male & Female, and one with recent knee replacement. All did just fine.

Our guide shared city sites and history as we rode up and down little hills and around tight curves.  The tour breaks at the Mill City Museum and our 20-min break turned into an hour.

review_305955105,"AMiLongIllinois147SO MUCH FUN!!Review ofSt. Paul History TourReviewed September 1, 2015My husband and I were visiting Minneapolis as a late birthday present for myself and we booked a Segway tour.  First, the staff are friendly and helpful.  I was super nervous about being able to do it and they were right when they said ""after five minutes the fear is gone!""  They take you outside and get you on a Segway and teach you the basics.  Then you get your helmet and watch a video...basic common sense and safety stuff.  Then you get your Segway and go across the street where they help you get on it you get to ride around in a circle for a bit.  This is great because it is really when you start to feel A LOT more comfortable.  Then you take off on your tour.  We had guides Lindsey and Chris (and a bunch more helpers!) and they were great.  They taught us about historical sights along the way and halfway through you stop at Mill City Museum for a free cookie and drink.  My husband and I did learn a lot about Minneapolis and the area and we had SO MUCH FUN riding the Segways.

I also loved the amazing and interesting perspectives from Chris who shared such detailed information about the history of Minneapolis. We saw so much and had so much fun traveling!
